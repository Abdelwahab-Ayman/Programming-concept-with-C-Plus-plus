## Classes

- Since the fundamental types provided by the language are quite limiting, C++ provides a mechanism for defining new (user-defined) types.
- A **class** is a user-defined type.
- A class specifies:
  1. How objects of the class are represented.
  2. The operations that can be performed on objects of the class.

### Accessibility
- Not all parts of a class are directly accessible to all code.
- The **interface** is the part of the class that is directly accessible to its users.
- The **implementation** is the part of the class that users access only indirectly through the interface.
