#### before we talk about functions we need to talk into two concepts,that relates to functions [Arguments - Parameters].
<hr>

* ###### Argument (a.k.a. actual parameter): argument is value supplied to function by caller; appears in parentheses of function-call operator. 
* ##### parameter (a.k.a. formal parameter): parameter is object/reference declared as part of function that acquires value on entry to function; appears in function definition/declaration. 

>although abuse of terminology, parameter and argument often used interchangeably.
